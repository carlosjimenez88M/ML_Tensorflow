# Hands odn Machine Learning with Scikit-learn, Keras & Tensorflow

This repository is a summary of exercises and practices from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron. However, instead of strictly following the book, I will include statistical applications and, whenever possible, exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Moreover, I will try to develop some exercises with development practices, which means keeping the functions in a utils format while developing the rest in a script.
